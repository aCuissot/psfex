With sextractor from `sudo apt-get install sextractor installed` and the psfex installation steps followed, the script runSextractorAndPsfex.sh should generate the psfex outputs given 2 args:
1. a prefix for the output directory which will contain psfex outputs
2. the input FITS

The source extractor output catalog should stay in the current directory.
